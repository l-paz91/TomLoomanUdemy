I'm currently working my way through this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine-cpp/
It's by Tom Looman; a former Unreal Engine engineer. I thought I'd give it a go, to see if I should recommend it
to others. 

Before starting this course on 23/03/2023, I had roughly 7 years of C++ and Unreal knowledge (4 of them working professionally
as an engine programmer at an Xbox game studio).

My code is similar to his in the video but using my own code style. In places I've changed what he's done to favour best practices
from our studio.

I'll put a full review in this readMe once I've finished the course.
